# Recommendation_System
- I created both Collaborative based recommendation system as well as Content based recommendation system
- I used pandas, numpy library and used TF-IDF for vectorization
- It is a Movie Recommendation System. I used the Movielens small size dataset. For large dataset, this code requires more memory to run.
